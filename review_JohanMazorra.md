Both functions "check_null" and "df_splits" from the functions folder seem to be working (was analyzed on Colab).
Everything seems to be in order, but I would suggest to clean up the lambdata13 folder since some of the classes are vaguely
named. For the usage in README.md, I would suggest to give a brief example of both functions to let the user know how
they work, since that's the main page that would be seen in the pypi.org website. Technically the package is working properly and
there's no bugs that are interfering with it. The most important part would be to let the user know the functionality
of the package and give examples so they're not lost in the loop when using the package. All in all, great job!
